# Architecture Overview

The RiggerShared platform is designed as part of the Rigger ecosystem for ChaseWhiteRabbit NGO. The architecture adheres to modern development practices, promoting modularity, scalability, and cross-platform compatibility.

## üìê Microservices Architecture

The platform employs a microservices architecture, which includes:

### 1. Service Registry

A service registry keeps track of all available services:
- **Service Discovery**: Automatically registers and deregisters services.
- **Load Balancing**: Uses round-robin and other balancing techniques.

### 2. Gateway API

The gateway manages APIs and serves as the single-entry point:
- **Authentication**: Validates user credentials and issues tokens.
- **Routing**: Directs requests to appropriate microservices.

### 3. Core Microservices

Each service is responsible for a specific domain:
- **User Service**: Manages user profiles.
- **Notification Service**: Handles emails and push notifications.
- **Analytics Service**: Collects and processes log data.

## üé® Front-end

The front-end of the platform supports various clients:

### Web

Built using modern frameworks:
- **React.js**: For dynamic and responsive UI.
- **Redux**: State management.

### Mobile

Cross-platform development:
- **Kotlin**: Native Android apps.
- **Swift**: Native iOS apps.
- **React Native**: Cross-platform compatibility.

## üîó Dependencies

Key libraries and frameworks include:

- **Axios**: For HTTP requests.
- **Docker**: Containerization of services.
- **Kubernetes**: Manages container orchestration.
- **Redis**: In-memory caching.
- **PostgreSQL**: RDBMS for structured data.
- **Zod**: For runtime schema validation.

## üìä Observability

The system includes comprehensive logging and monitoring:

### Grafana Dashboards

- **Visualize Performance Metrics**: CPU, Memory, Network.
- **Custom Alerts**: For detecting anomalies.

### ElasticSearch

Centralized logging and search capabilities:
- **Log Collection**: Gathers logs from all containers.
- **Traceability**: Easily trace requests and responses.

## üö® Security

Security considerations:

- **OAuth2**: For secure API authentication.
- **Rate Limiting**: To prevent abuse.
- **Data Encryption**: Both in transit and at rest.
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging of all operations.

## üöÄ Deployment Strategy

Deployment occurs via CI/CD pipelines:
- **GitLab Runners**: Automated testing and deployment.
- **Staging Environment**: Thorough testing before production.
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Zero-downtime deployment strategy.

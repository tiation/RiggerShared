# RiggerShared - Versioning & Release Management Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the enterprise-grade versioning and release management strategy for RiggerShared, following ChaseWhiteRabbit NGO standards and Tiation Technologies best practices.

## Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

We follow Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 specification:

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes that are not backwards compatible
- **MINOR**: New features that are backwards compatible  
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes that are backwards compatible

### Version Examples
- `1.0.0` - Initial stable release
- `1.1.0` - New feature added
- `1.1.1` - Bug fix applied
- `2.0.0` - Breaking changes introduced

## Release Channels

### 1. Development (`develop` branch)
- Pre-release versions: `1.0.0-dev.1`, `1.0.0-dev.2`
- Continuous integration builds
- Internal testing and validation

### 2. Staging (`staging` branch)  
- Release candidate versions: `1.0.0-rc.1`, `1.0.0-rc.2`
- User acceptance testing
- Performance validation

### 3. Production (`main` branch)
- Stable releases: `1.0.0`, `1.1.0`, `2.0.0`
- Public distribution
- Enterprise deployment ready

## Release Process

### Automated Release Pipeline

1. **Code Commit** → Triggers CI/CD pipeline
2. **Quality Gates** → Tests, linting, security scans
3. **Version Bump** → Automatic semantic versioning
4. **Build Artifacts** → Docker images, npm packages
5. **Deploy Staging** → Automated staging deployment
6. **Manual Approval** → Required for production
7. **Deploy Production** → Automated production deployment
8. **Release Notes** → Auto-generated changelog

### Release Schedule

- **Major Releases**: Quarterly (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)
- **Minor Releases**: Monthly or feature-driven
- **Patch Releases**: As needed for critical fixes
- **Hotfixes**: Emergency releases within 24 hours

## Version Control Strategy

### Branch Protection Rules

```yaml
main:
  - Require pull request reviews: 2
  - Require status checks to pass
  - Require branches to be up to date
  - Restrict pushes to admins only
  - No force pushes allowed

develop:
  - Require pull request reviews: 1
  - Require status checks to pass
  - Allow force pushes for admins

staging:
  - Require pull request reviews: 1
  - Require status checks to pass
  - No direct pushes allowed
```

### Automated Version Bumping

Using conventional commits and semantic-release:

```bash
# Install semantic-release
npm install --save-dev semantic-release

# Configuration in .releaserc.json
{
  "branches": ["main", "staging"],
  "plugins": [
    "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
    "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator",
    "@semantic-release/changelog",
    "@semantic-release/npm",
    "@semantic-release/docker",
    "@semantic-release/github"
  ]
}
```

## Deployment Strategy

### Blue-Green Deployment

1. **Blue Environment** (Current Production)
2. **Green Environment** (New Version)
3. **Health Checks** → Validate green environment
4. **Traffic Switch** → Route traffic to green
5. **Monitor** → Watch metrics and logs
6. **Rollback** → Switch back to blue if issues

### Canary Deployment

1. **Deploy to 5%** of production traffic
2. **Monitor metrics** for 30 minutes
3. **Increase to 25%** if stable
4. **Full deployment** after validation
5. **Automated rollback** on error thresholds

## Release Artifacts

### Docker Images
```bash
# Multi-platform builds
docker.sxc.codes/riggershared:1.0.0
docker.sxc.codes/riggershared:1.0.0-alpine
docker.sxc.codes/riggershared:latest
```

### NPM Packages
```bash
# Public registry
@rigger/shared@1.0.0

# Private registry  
@tiation/rigger-shared@1.0.0
```

### GitHub Releases
- Automated release notes
- Changelog comparison
- Binary asset attachments
- Security attestations

## Quality Gates

### Pre-Release Checks
- [ ] Unit tests pass (>90% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Security scans clean
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Breaking changes documented

### Post-Release Validation
- [ ] Health checks passing
- [ ] Error rates within SLA
- [ ] Performance metrics stable
- [ ] User feedback monitored
- [ ] Rollback plan tested

## Security & Compliance

### Vulnerability Management
- Daily dependency scans

- Mean time to recovery (MTTR)
- Change failure rate

### Key Performance Indicators
- Release success rate: >99%
- Rollback rate: <5%
- Time to production: <2 hours
- Critical bug response: <4 hours

## Communication Strategy

### Stakeholder Notifications
- **Development Team**: Slack integration
